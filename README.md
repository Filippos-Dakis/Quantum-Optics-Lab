# Quantum Optics Lab
Quantum Optics Lab is a side project that I work on my free time and the goal is to incorporate as many quantum optics features as possible. 

## Requirements & Installation
You can download and install the repo using the following commands. Open a terminal window in the directory you want to save the files and type:
```
git clone https://github.com/Filippos-Dakis/Quantum-Optics-Lab.git
cd Quantum-Optics-Lab/
```
It is recommend to install dependencies in a virtual environment to avoid messing your system-wide Python installation:
- Unix
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  . venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python -m jupyter notebook
  ```
- Windows
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  . venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python -m jupyter notebook
  ```
